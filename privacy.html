Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy outlines how your personal information is handled by the Share Status mobile application ("the App").

1. Information We Do Not Collect
The App does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information about its users. We do not require you to create an account, and we do not collect your name, email address, phone number, or any other personal data.

2. Information and Permissions Collected by Your Device
To function correctly, the App requires access to certain features on your device. These permissions are requested from you and are used solely to provide the App's core functionality.

Media Library / Photos: We request permission to access your device's photo and media library. This is to allow you to select images to use in your creations and to save your final designs directly to your gallery. We do not access or collect any of your photos without your explicit action.
Local Storage: The App uses local storage on your device (via AsyncStorage) to save your favorited templates. This data is stored locally on your device and is not accessed or transmitted by us.
3. Third-Party Services
The App uses third-party services that may collect information. The privacy policies of these third-party services govern their use of your information.

Firebase: We use the Firebase Realtime Database, a service provided by Google, to fetch and display the app's templates and categories. We do not use Firebase to store any user-specific or personalized data. You can read Google's privacy policy for Firebase here.
AdMob: The App may display banner ads provided by Google's AdMob service. AdMob may collect and use certain information to show relevant ads. You can learn more about how Google uses information from sites and apps that use their services here.

To provide you with a list of available templates and categories from our database.
5. Data Security
We are committed to protecting your privacy. The App is designed to minimize the collection of personal data, and any data accessed is handled on your local device. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
